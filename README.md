FundMe Smart Contract ðŸ’°
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to send funds to a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of smart contract development, including:

Receiving Ether: Implementing a payable function to accept cryptocurrency from users.

Managing State Variables: Storing and updating a list of funders and the total amount of funds received.

Controlling Access: Using modifiers to restrict functions to only the contract owner.

Withdrawal Logic: Creating a function to allow the contract owner to withdraw all accumulated funds.

The project is built with Solidity, the primary language for writing Ethereum smart contracts.

Key Components
FundMe.sol: This is the main smart contract file. It contains the logic for sending funds, tracking funders, and handling withdrawals.

PriceConverter.sol: This is a library contract used by FundMe.sol to get the current price of ETH in USD, ensuring that the minimum contribution is met.
